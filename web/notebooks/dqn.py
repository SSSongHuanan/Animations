### 3.1 Curse of dimensionality
Tabular methods work for small discrete state spaces. With images or continuous states, tables are impossible.

DQN approximates the action-value function with a neural network:  
**Q(s,a; θ) ≈ Q*(s,a)**

### 3.2 Two stabilizers
- **Experience replay**: store transitions and sample random minibatches.
- **Target network**: compute targets using a slowly-updated copy of parameters.
